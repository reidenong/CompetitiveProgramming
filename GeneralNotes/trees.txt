Trees

- No cycles
- Connected
- E = V-1
- One unique path between any 2 vertices

**Binary Tree Traversals**
pre-order(v) :
  visit(v)
  pre-order(v.left)
  pre-order(v.right)

in-order(v) :
  in-order(v.left)
  visit(v)
  in-order(v.right)

post-order(v) :
  post-order(v.left)
  post-order(v.right)
  visit(v)

Finding Articulation Points / Bridges
- Every vertex is a AP
- Every edge is a bridege

SSSP on weighted Tree
- There is only one unique path between any 2 vertices
- use BFS/DFS
- O(V)

APSP on weighted Tree
- For general graph, we do O(V^3) Floyd warshall 
- With tree, we can do O(V) SSSP on every vertice in graph
- O(V^2)

Diameter of weighted Tree
- For general graph, we do O(V^3) Floyd warshall with O(V^2) all-pair check
- WE need to do 2 tree traversals.
- 1. from any vertex s to find the furthest vertex x
  2. from vertex x to find furthest vertex y
- dist(x, y) is then the diameter of the graph
- O(V)
